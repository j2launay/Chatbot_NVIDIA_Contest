# Chatbot_NVIDIA_Contest
This project aims to develop an innovative chatbot specifically designed to provide reliable and verified information to diabetics, as part of the NVIDIA competition. The chatbot, named Qylo, harnesses the power of advanced techniques such as RAG and the robust Langchain library to ensure accurate and relevant responses

Qylo is programmed to understand and respond to a wide range of queries related to diabetes management, symptoms, treatment options, and more. It uses RAG, a cutting-edge deep learning technique that combines retrieval and generation methods to provide precise and contextually appropriate answers.

The Langchain library, on the other hand, is employed to manage and process complex language tasks. It enables the chatbot to understand and generate human-like text, ensuring that the interactions are not only informative but also engaging and user-friendly.

To ensure the reliability of the information, the chatbot is fed with data from verified and trusted sources. This includes health websites, and Top Doctors documentation, which are regularly updated to keep the information current.

The ultimate goal of Qylo is to provide diabetics with a reliable, accessible, and user-friendly tool to manage their condition better. By leveraging AI capabilities, this project aims to make a contribution to the field of healthcare technology.
