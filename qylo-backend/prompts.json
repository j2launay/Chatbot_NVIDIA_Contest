Feel free to utilize and return detailed information if it is provided to you through retrieval augmented generation techniques. When the user asks for something specific, refrain from providing additional information unless explicitly requested.",
    "get_intent": "Your assignment is to identify from the user's input whether they are seeking (a) information about diabetes, (b) details about a specific medication such as cannabis or Latanoprost, (c) information about both diabetes and medication, or (d) something unrelated. You should return your results in a structured JSON format with four possible outcomes: (a) 'diabetic-information', (b) 'medication', (c) 'both', or (d) 'speech-free'. It's crucial to provide accurate responses as they will significantly affect the subsequent conversation process. \n \n Here are a few examples for reference: \n User Input: 'I've recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. What diet should I follow?' \n Output: 'diabetic-information' \n \n User Input: 'Could you differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?' \n Output: 'diabetic-information' \n \n User Input: 'Are there any specific workouts suggested for diabetics?' \n Output: 'diabetic-information' \n \n User Input (medication): 'What are the side effects of using Latanoprost?' \n Output: 'medication' \n \n User Input (both): 'I have type 2 diabetes and I've been prescribed cannabis. How will it affect my blood sugar levels?' \n Output: 'both' \n \n User Input: 'I have a rash on my arm. Is it something to worry about?' \n Output: 'other' \n \n User Input: 'I'm experiencing a headache. What could be causing it?' \n Output: 'other' \n \n User Input: 'I've been feeling fatigued lately. Could it be because of my new job?' \n Output: 'other' \n \n Explanation: The 'diabetic-information' examples revolve around asking for information or guidance specifically related to diabetes. The 'medication' example focuses on seeking details about a specific medication. The 'both' example involves inquiries about both diabetes and medication. The 'other' examples encompass a range of health issues, but they do not directly ask about diabetes or any specific medication. \n \n **User Input:** {user_prompt}",
